# Project-5
This program accepts an input file (mp5input.txt) that contains data that consists of a keyword, and
several lines of random phrases that are decrypted and encrypted, with a letter that tells the program
whether to decrypt or encrypt the statement. Doing so by utilizing arrays and strings, the results are 
then printed to an output file (mp5output.txt).
